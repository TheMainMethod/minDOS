# MinDOS
 OS-like webpage mimicking some of Win95 features.

 Written mostly on vanilla JS, using Vite only for HMR.

 This project uses icons from [Alex Meub's Site](https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/).
 The Start Menu Logo is slightly modified though.

## Running the project

```pwsh
npm install
```

then

```pwsh
npm run dev
```

The site can then be previewed at [localhost](http://localhost:5173).

## Building

```pwsh
npm run build
```

Minified files will then be located inside dist folder.
